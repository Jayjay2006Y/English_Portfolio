      <h3>1. Albums from Pitchfork’s list I listened to and my thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        I listened to Playboi Carti’s album <em>I AM MUSIC</em>. I thought it was overrated. Everyone waited five years for a
        30-song album, but I feel like only about five songs were really good. Most of the tracks had the same sound and
        buildup, so it started to feel repetitive.

      <h3>2. Which albums from the list I listened to and which I liked most</h3>
      <p>
        There were a couple of albums where I had only heard one song on the radio. From Playboi Carti’s album, I had heard
        a few songs, but besides that, most of the albums I listen to weren’t on this list because they are older. I didn’t
        know many of the albums on Pitchfork’s list very well, so out of the ones I heard, I’d say Playboi Carti’s album was
        my favorite. I’m just not a big fan of most of the other artists on the list.

      <h3>3. Albums from 2025 that should be on the list</h3>
      <p>
        I think <em>Jackboys 2</em> by Travis Scott and Cactus Jack should have been on the list. It had several songs I liked,
        and it featured other artists like Don Toliver, whose music I also enjoy. I’m a big fan of Travis Scott and Don Toliver,
        and I’ve even been to concerts for both of them, so this album stood out to me.
