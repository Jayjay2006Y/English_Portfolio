      <p>Why I think One Piece is a masterpiece + images + quote.</p>

        If you don’t know what One Piece is, it is an anime known for having a huge number of episodes (over 1200), and I’m
        currently taking a break at episode 1000. It is a masterpiece for an anime to have over 1000 episodes and still be in
        the top 5 anime this year. Being so good for over 20 years is incredible.
      </p>

      <p>
        There isn’t just fighting; there are themes of discrimination, war, poverty, and liberation. It is an understatement
        to say it’s a masterpiece — it truly is. I only watch the anime and don’t read the manga, but the manga has sold around
        516–578 million copies, making it one of the best-selling book series of all time.

        The creator of One Piece is Eiichirō Oda. It is astonishing how he was able to come up with such an incredible story
        and world. One Piece is, in my books, a top 5 anime of all time.

      <blockquote>
        Pirates are evil? The Navy is righteous? These terms have always changed throughout history! Kids who have never seen
        peace and kids who have never seen war have different values! Those who stand at the top determine what’s wrong and
        what’s right!
