      <h3>Highlights</h3>
      <p>
        The 3 highlights were seeing my family in the US. I usually visit them once or twice a year,
        but it’s still always nice to see them again. The beaches in California were nice and sunny.
        It was great for a morning run and to swim. England and Ireland were also nice to visit and
        to see tourist spots like St Paul’s Cathedral or the Guinness brewery in Dublin.

      <h3>Lowlight</h3>
      <p>
        The lowlight was that I had a long layover because I flew from Zurich to Atlanta and had a connecting
        flight to Chicago O’Hare. First the flight was delayed by 4 hours. Then when we got on the flight and
        left the gate, we had to go back due to a medical emergency, and we stayed even longer because of bad
        weather.
